/**
 * Proposal for the end of protection of a version (German law: §§ 64, 65
 * UrhG): protection ends at the end of the 70th calendar year after the
 * death of the last of all persons involved.
 *
 * The proposal is for display only. It never sets the rights status; the
 * catalog librarian decides. Rules from the expert report of the rights
 * holders:
 * - Unknown means protected: without persons, or when any person lacks a
 *   secured year of death (living, unknown, approximate) or is not securely
 *   identified, there is no "public domain" proposal.
 * - Unnamed is not anonymous: missing names never lead to the term for
 *   anonymous works (§ 66 UrhG).
 * - All roles count, including arrangers, translators and editors. The flag
 *   "text written for this composition" (§ 65 (3) UrhG) does not shorten
 *   anything, because both parts are needed to sing the version anyway.
 *
 * Special cases (milestone 0.8), switched on per version by the catalog
 * librarian; both protect for 25 years after the end of the year in which
 * the edition or the work first appeared (§ 69 UrhG):
 * - scientific edition (§ 70 UrhG): an edition of works or texts that are
 *   not protected, made by scholarly work and clearly different from
 *   earlier editions (e.g. an urtext or a critical edition);
 * - posthumous work (§ 71 UrhG): a work whose protection has ended and that
 *   appeared (or was performed in public) for the first time afterwards.
 * Who wrote it (milestone 0.11): when the roles are given, "public domain"
 * is only proposed when a composer is recorded and, for a version with text,
 * a lyricist, unless the catalog librarian marked the melody or the text as
 * traditional (with evidence) or the version as without text; otherwise a
 * missing person with rights of their own could be overlooked. A version
 * whose melody and text are both traditional (or without text) is proposed
 * by the other persons, and as public domain when there are none (an
 * arrangement of a folk song still counts with its arranger).
 *
 * With a special case, persons involved only as editors count with these
 * 25 years instead of 70 years after their death; every other person still
 * counts as usual, and the later of both ends decides. Without the year the
 * special term is unknown, and unknown means protected.
 *
 * Result:
 * - `status`: `free` (protection has ended), `protected` (ends at a known
 *   date) or `unknown` (to be treated as protected)
 * - `until`: last day of protection (YYYY-12-31) when known
 * - `freeSince`: first free day (YYYY-01-01) when known
 * - `reason`: key of the explanation, `parameters`: values for it
 * - `blocking`: persons (or the missing year, without a person) that
 *   prevent a date, each with its reason key
 * - `special`: only with special cases: each case with the year and the
 *   end of its term
 *
 * Pure function without Nextcloud dependencies, so that it can be unit
 * tested.
 *
