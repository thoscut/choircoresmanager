# Legal background

**English** | [Deutsch](de/rechtlicher-hintergrund.md)

This page explains which rules the rights checks of the music archive rest
on and where their limits are. It describes German law as of October 2026
(app version 0.11); the German page,
[Rechtlicher Hintergrund](de/rechtlicher-hintergrund.md), is the reference.

## Protection terms

- A work is protected until the end of the 70th year after the death of its
  author (§ 64 UrhG). Terms always run to the end of the calendar year
  (§ 69 UrhG).
- For a work created jointly, the death of the last surviving author counts
  (§ 65 (1) UrhG). For a musical composition with words created for it,
  composer and lyricist count together (§ 65 (3) UrhG).
- An **arrangement** has a right of its own if it is a creation of its own
  (§ 3 UrhG): 70 years after the death of the arranger, even if the original
  is long free. The same holds for a translation of the text.

The app counts this way: protection ends at the end of the 70th year after
the death of the last person involved in the version. **Unknown means
protected:** an unknown or only approximate year of death, a living person,
an uncertain identification and "no name" give no suggestion of public
domain. A work without a name does not count as an anonymous work under
§ 66 UrhG, as the name is usually just not recorded.

Since 0.11 a suggestion of public domain needs a person for the composition
and one for the text, or the marking "traditional" or "without text" with
evidence. If a part is missing, the suggestion says "unknown".

### Special cases: §§ 70 and 71 UrhG

- **Scientific edition (§ 70 UrhG):** an edition of works no longer
  protected, made by scholarly work and clearly different from earlier
  editions, is protected for 25 years: from its appearance or, if it did not
  appear in that time, from its making. The app counts cautiously from the
  year of appearance.
- **Posthumous work (§ 71 UrhG):** whoever first publishes or performs in
  public a work whose protection had already ended has a right for 25 years,
  counted from the earlier of the two events.
- Reconstructions, completions or realisations of a figured bass by an
  editor are often an **arrangement** (70 years after death). Record that
  person with the role "Arranger", not "Editor". An editor without creative
  work of their own is not protected at all outside § 70; the app still
  counts them with 70 years, which is cautious.

## Public domain work, protected edition

A work in the public domain does not make every edition free. Protected can
be:

- an arrangement, for example a choral setting (§ 3 UrhG),
- a scientific edition (§ 70 UrhG),
- a posthumous work (§ 71 UrhG),
- a translation or new words.

The engraving itself has no right of its own in Germany (unlike, for
example, the United Kingdom). The terms of sale of a publisher may still
bind by contract. That is why the app assesses the **version**, not the
work.

### Folk songs and traditional melodies

A melody without a known author is free. An **insignificant arrangement**
of a musical work that is not protected is no arrangement of its own (§ 3
sentence 2 UrhG), such as merely setting a melody with simple chords. A
worked-out choral setting usually is an arrangement with protection of its
own. Mark melody or text as "traditional" only with evidence, for example a
folk song collection, and still record the arranger.

## Photocopies of sheet music

Sheet music may in principle be copied **only with the consent** of the
rights holder, also for the choir's own use (§ 53 (4) a UrhG). Copying by
hand is exempt. The only other exceptions are copies for one's own archive
(see below) and works out of print for at least two years.

The app therefore compares photocopied copies and the number of copies with
the licenses "Copies for the binders" and warns when a license is missing
or there are more copies than it allows. It blocks nothing.

### Who grants which rights

- **Publishers** grant the rights to copy sheet music. The **VG
  Musikedition** manages part of these rights and makes, for example,
  blanket agreements with churches and associations. Ask your choir
  association whether such an agreement covers you.
- **GEMA** grants the rights for performances (concerts; hence the
  programme list) and recordings. A GEMA license for a concert allows no
  copies of the music.

## Preservation copies

A copy for one's **own archive** is allowed without consent (§ 53 (2)
sentence 1 no. 2 UrhG), also of sheet music. The conditions:

- The original is the choir's **own** copy.
- The copy is necessary, for example as a reserve for a crumbling
  original; it does not replace buying.
- The copy is neither distributed nor communicated to the public (§ 53 (6)
  UrhG). The app never shares, plays or exports preservation copies.
- A **digital** copy is additionally allowed only if the archive acts in
  the public interest and pursues no economic purpose (§ 53 (2) sentence 2
  no. 3 UrhG). An internal choir archive hardly meets that by the
  prevailing reading. The rules for libraries and archives (§§ 60e, 60f
  UrhG) apply only to institutions open to the public.

For a choir archive this means: a paper copy of its own original as a
reserve is usually covered. A **scan** of a protected print needs, if in
doubt, the consent of the publisher. The app warns about scans and
transcriptions without a license for digitisation.

### Optical music recognition and MusicXML

A MusicXML transcription of a protected print, by optical music recognition
(OMR) or entered by hand into a notation program, is a reproduction (§ 16
UrhG), not copying by hand in the sense of § 53 (4). It needs the same
consent as a scan (use "Digitisation").

## Sharing with choir members and the public

- **No § 60a for choirs.** The exception for teaching (§ 60a UrhG) applies
  to educational institutions, not to choirs. There is no general exception
  for associations; the former § 52a UrhG was repealed in 2018.
- **Making available (§ 19a UrhG).** Whoever makes sheet music or playback
  of a protected composition available online to many needs a right for
  that. Even a large choir can be "the public" (§ 15 (3) UrhG) when its
  members are not personally connected. The app therefore requires
  confirmed public domain or a license for exactly that use for every kind
  of sharing: singers' portal, self-printing, practice audio, online
  publication, online playback (audio), download and printing by members.
- **An excerpt counts as the whole sheet.** A few measures are still part
  of the work; the app shares only released versions.
- **What reaches a browser can be saved.** The public pages have no download
  button, but the MusicXML of the excerpt is in the page, and a scan can be
  saved from the PDF viewer. Do not promise a publisher "no download".
- **Practice audio files** are made in the browser; the server only grants
  the permission and records it. When a license ends, the releases end at
  once, but practice files already made and saved scans stay with the
  members. Pass on the license's duties to delete to the members.
- **Internal playback.** For the archive roles an imported, not yet
  confirmed status "public domain" is enough for playback. That is
  defensible internally; only what is confirmed is shared.
- **IMSLP and CPDL.** The public repertoire page links only to the page of
  the work. Not every edition offered there is free in Germany, for example
  arrangements or editions that are free only in Canada or the USA. For
  links without a profit motive the liability risk is low (CJEU, C-160/15,
  *GS Media*).

## Public pages: imprint and privacy policy

- A public service usually needs an **imprint** (§ 5 DDG; disputed for
  association pages, but common) and a **privacy policy** (Art. 13 GDPR).
- For the public pages Nextcloud processes **IP addresses**: in the web
  server log (with the address of the link), in the brute-force protection,
  in the rate limit and in `nextcloud.log` on errors. The legal basis is the
  security of the server (Art. 6 (1) f GDPR).
- Before switching on "Public links" and "Public repertoire page", enter the
  addresses of imprint and privacy policy under *Administration → Theming*.
  The module settings warn while one is missing. Text blocks are in the
  [privacy templates](privacy-templates.md).

## Agents and AI providers

An agent that runs on a cloud language model passes everything it reads to
the provider of the model. That is processing on behalf (Art. 28 GDPR),
possibly in a third country (Art. 44 ff. GDPR). Give agents only the role
"Proposals (tools)": it reads neither the folder book nor its audit
entries. More in the
[administration guide, section 13](admin-guide.md#13-agents-and-the-api).

## Data protection in the archive

What the app stores about people, for how long, and how to give access or
erase is in the
[administration guide, section 10](admin-guide.md#10-data-protection);
templates for the register of processing activities and the information of
members are in the [privacy templates](privacy-templates.md).
