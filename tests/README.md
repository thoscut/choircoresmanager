# Tests

There are two kinds of tests. They are kept apart on purpose:

| | Unit tests | Integration tests |
|---|---|---|
| Location | `tests/Unit/` | `tests/Integration/` |
| Needs a Nextcloud server | no | yes, with the app installed |
| Runner | PHPUnit (`tests/phpunit.xml`) | plain PHP scripts |
| Runs in CI | yes | yes, with the demo data |

## Unit tests

The unit tests run without a Nextcloud server and without a database. The
public Nextcloud API (`OCP`) comes from the `nextcloud/ocp` package in the
version of the **oldest supported Nextcloud** (see `composer.json`), so a test
fails when the app uses an API that this version does not have. Nextcloud
services (`IDBConnection`, `ITimeFactory`, `IUserManager`, …) and the mappers
are replaced by PHPUnit test doubles; entities and the app's own logic are
real.

Requirements: PHP 8.2 or newer with the extensions `ctype`, `dom`, `json`,
`mbstring`, `tokenizer`, `xml` and `zip` (without `zip` the spreadsheet tests
are skipped), and Composer.

```sh
composer install                 # app dev dependencies and the tools in vendor-bin/
composer test:unit               # all unit tests
vendor/bin/phpunit -c tests/phpunit.xml --filter ImportServiceTest
vendor/bin/phpunit -c tests/phpunit.xml --testdox
```

The suite fails on warnings, notices, deprecations and risky tests.

What is covered:

| Test | Subject |
|---|---|
| `Service/CatalogCsvTest` | CSV parsing (BOM, double BOM, `;`, quotes, CRLF in cells, empty lines), writing byte for byte like Python's `csv` module with `QUOTE_MINIMAL` and CRLF (reference output embedded), round trip, legacy publication rules |
| `Service/FieldValueTest` | value checks per field type, length in characters, strict calendar dates (e.g. `2026-02-31`) |
| `Service/FieldsTest` | the field registry against the schema of the migrations: every column has a field or is listed as internal, `max` equals the column length, types and NOT NULL fit, every legacy CSV column maps to a field |
| `Db/EntitySchemaTest` | every entity against the table of its mapper: columns, types, nullability |
| `Db/LicenseTest` | `License::covers()` (uses, first and last day) |
| `Service/RightsServiceTest` | releases for the singers' portal and the print station, licenses, confirmation, portal workflow, transactions |
| `Service/RightsPolicyTest` | viewing and playback of scores, practice audio files (roles, confirmed public domain or license), preservation copies |
| `Service/PracticeAudioServiceTest` | the gatekeeper for practice audio files: an allowed export is recorded with measures, voice, mode and format; refused and invalid requests are not |
| `Service/ImportServiceTest` | CSV import: invalid values skipped, decision fields never overwritten, shelf marks normalized, dry run rolled back, snapshot before a real import |
| `Service/ProposalServiceTest` | proposed values stored exactly (also `0`, `false`, `""`), accepting applies them |
| `Service/LifeDatesTest` | life dates from free text with their precision (ranges, full dates, "ca.", "?", living, before Christ) |
| `Service/ProtectionTermTest` | protection proposal: 70 years after the end of the year of death, the last person decides, "unknown means protected" |
| `Service/FullBackupServiceTest` | format check of the complete backup before a restore |
| `Service/XlsxReaderTest` | reading a synthetic .xlsx: shared and rich text, inline strings, gaps, sheet order, damaged files |
| `Service/OdsWriterTest` | the written .ods: package structure, sheets, escaping |
| `Service/PerformanceImportServiceTest` | counting rule for documented performances, detection of the own choir |
| `Service/CatalogServiceTest` | repertoire figures (documented or imported), works after merges |
| `Service/StatisticsServiceTest` | aggregation of the statistics without a database: period, copies per binder, new copies per year (audit log or creation date, time zone of the user), rights states, valid versions, license groups, concerts and pieces per year, most performed works and composers, repertoire classes, works not sung for a long time, tasks by age, protection terms, open rights questions, licenses and accessions of the annual report; 2,000 copies aggregated in well under a second |
| `Service/StatisticsCsvTest` | CSV of the statistics and the annual report: every table under its heading, translated labels, formula cells neutralized |
| `Service/InputTest`, `Service/SortTest`, `Db/MergeTest` | request data checks, typed sorting, what a merge recorded |
| `Controller/ControllerSecurityTest` | route attributes of every controller (no public page, CSRF skipped only for plain downloads, admin-only settings, brute-force and rate limits), headers of the score file response and of the scan beside the score (PDF viewer only, framed by the app only), the app page's content security policy; every route of the API for agents is an OCS route under `/api/v1/` with `agent_api` plus the module of the same function in the UI, `NoAdminRequired`, a rate limit, no `NoCSRFRequired` and no CORS, and answers 404 with OCS meta when switched off |
| `Controller/ApiV1ControllerTest` | the API for agents with the services as test doubles: search with filters and cursor pages in shelf order, the fixed fields, preservation copies only for the roles that may view them, no account names, errors as OCS exceptions (400, 403, 404, 500 without internal details), tasks and proposals answer 201, own proposals, concerts by date, module status and permissions |
| `Service/ApiV1ViewsTest`, `Service/TextReferenceTest` | cursors (opaque, checked, stable when entries are added), snake_case statistics, values without JSON; the server's text reference follows the rules and examples of the UI (`src/__tests__/references.test.ts`) |
| `Service/ScoreServiceTest` | only real MusicXML reaches the browser (root element, document type declarations, `.mxl` contents, size limit) |
| `Service/UserFilesTest`, `Service/RequestBoundaryTest` | reading uploaded files with a size limit, limits of request data (unknown fields, list sizes) |
| `Notification/NotifierTest` | notification texts, no internal error texts |
| `Service/IcsWriterTest`, `Service/ConcertIcsTest` | calendar files after RFC 5545: CRLF, folding after 75 octets without splitting umlauts or other multi-octet characters, escaping of `,;\` and line breaks, time zone definitions (daylight saving time, half-hour offsets), all-day entries, stable UIDs, deadlines as separate entries, cancelled concerts |
| `Service/ConcertDeadlinesTest`, `Service/DueServiceTest` | the deadlines 10, 8 and 6 weeks before a concert and the confirmation after it; which roles see them on the start page |
| `Service/ConcertCalendarServiceTest` | entries in the account's own calendars (test double in `Support/FakeCalendar`): only writable calendars, roles, adding again updates instead of duplicating, cancelled concerts are only updated |
| `Dashboard/DueWidgetTest` | the dashboard widget: only for accounts with a role, items and deep links of the start page, no personal data |
| `Service/TranscriptionReportParserTest` | reports of transcriptions (`bericht/1`): fields and review points with their roles, measures ("12–14", "T. 5"), questions as objects, `erledigt`, warnings for unknown and missing fields; refused: invalid JSON, too large, nested too deeply, wrong types, paths and control characters in the base name, a base name of another shelf mark |
| `Service/MusicXmlCorrectionTest` | small corrections: pitch, alteration, accidental (placed in schema order) and syllable are applied to the stored document, which is kept otherwise; refused: other note values, added or removed notes and measures, renumbered measures, other attributes and elements, invalid values, markup or line breaks in a syllable, no change, a document type with an internal subset |
| `Service/ReviewServiceTest` | who decides a review point (librarian everything, conductor the musical points), allowed decisions (`corrected` only by the app, text for an order, reason for dismissing), questions need the tasks, catalog fields of a report |
| `Service/CorrectionServiceTest` | name of the corrected file: dated, in the account's language, numbered when it exists, an earlier suffix replaced, long names shortened without cutting a character |
| `Service/FilesIntegrationServiceTest`, `Listener/FilesScriptListenerTest` | opening from the Files app: the copy of a Nextcloud file only for files the account sees (the same 404 for unlisted and foreign files), the archive folder as the account sees it; the script only for accounts with a role or admins, while the module is on |

`Support/MigratedSchema` runs all migrations in `lib/Migration` against an
in-memory Doctrine schema. `EntitySchemaTest` discovers the mappers in
`lib/Db`. New migrations, mappers and entities are therefore checked without
changing the tests; a new column of a work, version or copy needs a field in
`Service/Fields` or an entry in `FieldsTest::INTERNAL_COLUMNS`.

`tests/stubs/` holds stubs of private server classes that the public API refers
to, and of the Files app event the app listens to (used by the unit tests and
by Psalm).

## Integration tests

The scripts in `tests/Integration/` run against a real Nextcloud instance with
the app installed and a catalog imported. They change data inside a database
transaction that is rolled back at the end and remove the files they export.
Run them only on a test instance, never on a production system.

Run them as the user that owns the Nextcloud data (the web server user). The
classes are loaded from the app installed in Nextcloud; the scripts
themselves may lie anywhere, together with `harness.php`:

```sh
sudo -u www-data php tests/Integration/workflow_test.php      /var/www/nextcloud <uid> <shelfmark-a> <shelfmark-b>
sudo -u www-data php tests/Integration/notifications_test.php /var/www/nextcloud <uid> <shelfmark>
sudo -u www-data php tests/Integration/tasks_links_test.php   /var/www/nextcloud <uid> <shelfmark>
sudo -u www-data php tests/Integration/events_test.php        /var/www/nextcloud <uid> <programme-csv> <song-list-csv> <shelfmark-a> <shelfmark-b>
sudo -u www-data php tests/Integration/maintenance_test.php   /var/www/nextcloud <uid> <persons-csv> <shelfmark-a> <shelfmark-b> <shelfmark-free>
sudo -u www-data php tests/Integration/practice_audio_test.php /var/www/nextcloud <uid> <shelfmark-protected> <shelfmark-preservation-copy> <shelfmark-public-domain>
sudo -u www-data php tests/Integration/statistics_test.php    /var/www/nextcloud <uid> [<programme-csv>]
sudo -u www-data php tests/Integration/backup_test.php        /var/www/nextcloud <uid>
sudo -u www-data php tests/Integration/calendar_test.php      /var/www/nextcloud <uid>
sudo -u www-data php tests/Integration/modules_test.php       /var/www/nextcloud <uid> <shelfmark-protected>
sudo -u www-data php tests/Integration/api_v1_test.php        /var/www/nextcloud <uid> <shelfmark> <shelfmark-preservation-copy>
sudo -u www-data php tests/Integration/review_test.php        /var/www/nextcloud <uid> <shelfmark-with-musicxml>
sudo -u www-data php tests/Integration/files_integration_test.php /var/www/nextcloud <uid>
```

`statistics_test.php` fixes no figures of a catalog, so it runs on any
imported catalog: it checks that sums and states add up, compares the
statistics with the catalog list, the release lists, the resubmission list
and the checksums, books a concert, an accession and a license and checks
the difference, and finally fills the catalog up to 2,000 copies to measure
the time of the whole call (rolled back like everything else).

`calendar_test.php` needs the dav app (calendars). It creates a calendar of
its own for `<uid>`, adds a concert with its deadlines through Nextcloud's
calendar interface, adds it again after a change and after the cancellation
(updates instead of duplicates), checks the calendar files with Nextcloud's
iCalendar parser (Sabre VObject) and the dashboard widget; the calendar is
deleted and everything is rolled back.

`modules_test.php` switches all modules on, then concerts, the dashboard
widget and the rights off and on again: the routes answer 404, the daily
checks, the start page and the widget leave the concerts out and withdraw
their notification, the concert and its programme stay, and playback and
practice audio of a protected version stay refused. Everything is rolled
back, and at the end the module switches are exactly as before (also those
that were not stored).

`api_v1_test.php` takes the controllers of the API for agents from
Nextcloud's dependency injection container with `<uid>` as the account of the
session. It reads (module status, search with filters and every page,
a copy, a text reference, the due list, tasks, concerts, statistics, the
review of a copy page by page and the correction orders), creates a
proposal and a task, hands in transcription reports it writes itself (so
the catalog needs no demo report; one point is decided as a correction
order through the service, as the score view does), checks what is refused
(proposing a decision, answering for another role, unknown objects, invalid
cursors, a report naming another copy, writing as reader, the preservation
copy for reader and contributor, deciding a review point or saving a
correction as contributor through the routes of the UI) and that every
route answers 404 without `agent_api`, the task routes without `tasks` and
the review routes without `transcription_review`. The second shelf mark is
made an internal preservation copy inside the transaction when it is not
one, so any two copies of different versions do. For the other roles it
gives the account's groups the role `reader` or `contributor` for a while.
Everything is rolled back; the module switches and the role groups are
restored exactly.
`review_test.php` writes a transcription report (`bericht/1`) from the
shelf mark, the name and the measures and parts of the copy's score, reads
it, decides its review points (confirmed, correction order, question as a
task, dismissed; the conductor only musical points), saves a small
correction in the app as a new file next to the old one (the old file stays
unchanged; changed note values, added notes and a changed number of
measures are refused), runs the file sync and reads a second round that
closes the points no longer named. The copy needs a MusicXML file the
account may read, in a folder it may write to; the new file is deleted at
the end and everything else rolled back. It runs on any catalog: no fixed
titles or figures.
`files_integration_test.php` checks the action "Open in music archive" of
the Files app: a listed MusicXML file names its copy and opens the score
view, a PDF opens its copy, an unlisted file of the archive folder, an
unknown file id and a file of another account all get the same 404 (the
latter also when it is entered in the archive), the route answers 404 while
the module is off, and only an account with a role gets the script. It
creates a second account without a role (random password, never printed)
with one file and deletes it at the end; everything else is rolled back and
the module switches are restored exactly.

`<uid>` must hold the role `librarian`; each script's header lists further
requirements (CSV paths are relative to the user's files). `backup_test.php`
first adds a record to every app table (license, proposal, task, link,
concert with an item, person with a contribution, transcription report with a
review point, merge), so that the backup round trip covers every table
with content.

All scripts use `harness.php`: it prints one line per check and ends with
exit code 0 only when every check passed. A failed check, an uncaught
exception, a fatal error or a script that stops early ends with exit code 1
(Nextcloud's own error handling would otherwise end such a run with 0);
missing arguments end with exit code 2.

### Integration tests in CI (demo data)

The CI job `integration` runs all eleven scripts against a freshly installed
Nextcloud 33 and 35 (release archives from download.nextcloud.com, checked
against their SHA-512 checksum) with MariaDB 11.8 and PHP 8.3. The job
installs the app with its built frontend, builds the public demo data
(`node tools/demo/build.mjs`, see `tools/demo/README.md`) and calls

```sh
bash tools/ci/integration-demo.sh /path/to/nextcloud
```

The script refuses to run when the catalog is not empty or the test account
exists. It creates a test account (random password, never printed) in its
own group, gives the group the roles `librarian` and `reader` and no other
role, copies the demo folder into the account's files (`occ files:scan`),
sets it as archive folder, imports `_Import/catalog.csv` (dry run, then for
real) and runs the file sync. It checks the figures of
`tools/demo/README.md`: 23 rows, 7 with MusicXML, 1 preservation copy,
19 × public domain, 2 × protected, 2 × open; 30 files (23 PDF, 4 MXL,
3 MusicXML), 29 assigned, `Mappe_4/4-04_…pdf` not assignable, `LIESMICH.txt`
ignored, `_Import` skipped, 4-3 without a file; the two transcription reports
of the demo (1-1, 2-1) are counted apart (`reports`: 2 files, 2 assigned, 2
imported; 32 new file rows). It switches every module on
(`occ notenarchiv:modules preset complete`; a new installation starts with
the preset "standard") and, after the import, the interface for agents
(`occ notenarchiv:modules enable agent_api`, which no preset touches). Then
it runs the tests with these shelf marks of the demo catalog:

| Script | Arguments | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `workflow_test.php` | `2-2 1-3` | A is confirmed as public domain, B stays unconfirmed |
| `notifications_test.php` | `2-1` | |
| `tasks_links_test.php` | `1-2` | |
| `events_test.php` | `_Import/performances.csv _Import/song-lists.csv 2-1 3-1` | 2-1 is current repertoire; the first ambiguous programme line (1-1 or 3-1) is resolved to 3-1 |
| `calendar_test.php` | – | creates its own calendar and concert (rolled back) |
| `maintenance_test.php` | `_Import/persons.csv 2-4 3-2 2-1` | 2-4 and 3-2 are two copies of the same print with an uncertainly identified editor; all persons of 2-1 died more than 70 years ago |
| `practice_audio_test.php` | `2-6 3-1 2-2` | 2-6 is protected without a license for practice audio, 3-1 an internal preservation copy, 2-2 public domain but not confirmed |
| `statistics_test.php` | `_Import/performances.csv` | the performance list gives the statistics concerts to count; no fixed figures |
| `modules_test.php` | `2-6` | 2-6 is protected without a license for practice audio |
| `api_v1_test.php` | `1-1 3-1` | 1-1 is public domain with MusicXML (and a demo report, which the test's own reports do not touch), 3-1 the internal preservation copy |
| `review_test.php` | `1-2` | MXL with four staves and without a demo report, so the review points of the demo reports do not interfere |
| `files_integration_test.php` | – | finds a MusicXML file and a PDF of copies itself; `LIESMICH.txt` is the unlisted file; creates and deletes a second account |
| `backup_test.php` | – | |

Finally (step 7) an **agent without a language model** uses the MCP server
(`tools/mcp`, built by the CI job; the script builds it when
`tools/mcp/dist` is missing). The script creates an account with the role
`contributor` (group `demo-agents`, random password passed only through the
environment) and, unless `NC_URL` names the web server of the instance,
starts PHP's built-in web server for the Nextcloud directory
(`php -S 127.0.0.1:8080`). `tools/mcp/ci/agent-demo.mjs` gets an app password
from `/ocs/v2.php/core/getapppassword` without printing it, starts the MCP
server over stdio like Claude Desktop would and calls `tools/list`,
`modules`, `search_catalog` (1-1, and 3-1 hidden), `list_due`,
`text_reference`, `propose_change` (the key of the version of 1-1, to be
rejected), `list_my_proposals`, `create_task`, `answer_task` (refused:
another role), `get_review` (the points of the demo report of 1-1, read by
the file sync), `list_correction_orders` and `submit_transcription_report`
(a new round of `tools/demo/reports/1-1.json` with one more point; the same
report again changes nothing; a report naming 3-1 is refused). It checks
that confirming rights, deciding a review point and saving a correction
with the app password are refused with 403 (internal API) and have no
route in api/v1, that
`occ notenarchiv:modules disable agent_api` makes the API answer 404 with
OCS meta, that the server log holds no secret, and that read-only mode
offers no writing tools; then it deletes the app password and checks that
it no longer signs in. `tools/ci/agent-demo-cleanup.php` rejects the
agent's proposals, discards its tasks and dismisses the review points of its
report as the librarian (the report stays as evidence); the account, its
group and the role are removed again.

To run the whole script against an existing test instance with a web
server, pass its URL:

```sh
NC_URL=https://nc33.example.org bash tools/ci/integration-demo.sh /var/www/nextcloud
```

The person and performance lists are imported only inside the tests'
rolled-back transactions. `events_test.php` expects no concert at all and
`maintenance_test.php` expects new persons in its dry run, so a real import
of these lists must never come before them.

Environment variables `CI_USER`, `CI_GROUP`, `DEMO_DIR`, `PHP`,
`AGENT_USER`, `AGENT_GROUP`, `NC_URL` and `NC_PORT` change the defaults. The script ends with exit code 0 only when every check and every
test passed and prints the lines of a failed test. On an instance that
already holds a catalog, back it up first (`occ notenarchiv:export --full`),
empty it, run the script with an account of its own, then empty the catalog
again, restore the backup (`occ notenarchiv:restore`), delete the account and
set the archive folder and the roles back.

## Static analysis and coding standard

```sh
composer psalm      # Psalm, see psalm.xml (no baseline)
composer cs:check   # PHP-CS-Fixer with the Nextcloud coding standard, dry run
composer cs:fix     # apply the coding standard
composer lint       # php -l on all PHP files
```

The CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs all of these, the unit
tests on PHP 8.2, 8.3 and 8.4, the frontend checks, the REUSE check, the
check that `openapi.json` is current (`composer run openapi`, then
`git diff --exit-code`), the build and tests of the MCP server and the
integration tests with the demo data and the agent run on Nextcloud 33 and
35.

## Licensing (REUSE)

The repository follows the [REUSE specification](https://reuse.software) 3.3,
like Nextcloud's own apps: every file states its copyright and license, the
license texts are in `LICENSES/`. A new file gets an SPDX header in the form
of its neighbours, for example in PHP after `declare(strict_types=1);`:

```php
/**
 * SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2026 Thomas Scheel and Notenarchiv contributors
 * SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0-or-later
 */
```

Vue files and Markdown start with `<!--` and `  - SPDX-…` lines, TypeScript
and JavaScript with a `/** … */` block, shell scripts with `#` lines after
the shebang. Code, templates, tests, icons, translations and screenshots are
`AGPL-3.0-or-later`; the demo data (`tools/demo/catalog.json`,
`tools/demo/scores/`) and trivial configuration (lock files, package
manifests, linter and tool configuration) are `CC0-1.0`. Files that cannot
hold a comment (JSON, images) or must stay unchanged (`appinfo/info.xml`,
generated `l10n/`) are listed in `REUSE.toml` instead; a new file in a folder
listed there needs nothing. Check with

```sh
pipx run reuse lint   # or: pip install reuse && reuse lint
```

The CI job `reuse` runs the same check.
